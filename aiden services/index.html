                                <p>Welcome to Aiden's Services, and I come from a place that no cheater is really expected to come from. I am an ex-server admin, who has now turned into a cheater (ironically). The services we offer contain cheats and nitro boosts. I offer some of the fastest rates of responses inside of the community, so when you would like to buy something, you will get that product as fast as you can blink. On our website, you can view all of my media, a guide to cheat on Rust, and a place to buy cheats.</p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <h3><p style="font-family: 'Ariel', sans-serif;">Terms and Conditions</p> </h3>                               
                                <p>
                                    We do not accept returns/refunds unless a service isn't fulfilled completely to our standards.
                                    Any chargebacks will result in the termination of any key(s) that you have purchased.
                                    If your game account gets banned, then that is on you. We will not refund for that issue, as it is a known to happen event while cheating.</p>

                                Welcome to this guide of how to cheat on servers in Rust. This guide is focused on the newer cheaters inside of the scene, who may not know stuff that the older cheaters may know. Inside of this guide, there will be insider secrets from admins inside of various servers. The owner and creator of this guide is a past admin of the Rust servers: LoneRust, AndysolAM, and RustAcademy. These servers had been blinded by the fact that in the past, I was a cheater. A short story behind this, is that I had cheated 2 years ago, and had stopped cheating half a year before I got staff on those servers. I had hidden this past due to some of the knowledge that is stated inside of this guide, so I suggest you listen into this information. In advance of this guide, I would like to thank all of the people who had helped me with this guide, as I could not do it on my own.

                                <p>
                                    Some of the most basic parts of cheating is to know the cheat you are using, the server you are on, and the features you are using. An example of why this is important is because some servers like Rusty Moose (official) have server sided anti cheats that pick up commands like noclip, debug camera, and features like magic bullet, hitbox override, and more. These detections all added up will end up automatically banning you from the server. Some of the most basic and important features that you should use while cheating (rage) are: Aimbot/Silent Aim, ESP, omnisprint, magic bullet, desync (weapon), bullet thickness, instant eoka, and hit override. Some of these features may not work on some servers due to anti cheats, but they will help you instantly kill people with AK, Eoka, and other guns. Some of these features are self explanatory, but some may be harder for people to know about if they are new to cheating.
                                    Some users of cheats use some features that are extremely blatant to all servers that have the simple plugins of anticheats and such. An example of this is that they will dig up stashes by just standing on them and looking down, like anyone would regularly do to their own stashes. What people don’t know at times, is that some servers like AndysolAM/RustAcademy have a plugin called “Stash Traps” which would notify admins inside of a Discord channel using webhook/announcements saying “Username had opened a auto generated stash trap (Number of times they opened one)”. More plugins also include implementations of RustAdmin/Battlemetrics, which would auto kick you for having a certain Steam level, real hour count of playtime on Rust, or your account being banned on a server that has shared ban lists with other servers. An example of this is that if you get banned on AndysolAM, you will get banned automatically on RustAcademy. This is because they have shared ban lists, and are also owned by the same owners. 
                                        Some servers are smart to cheat on, while others are not smart to cheat on. For example, if you cheat on a Facepunch server, using certain features or you reach a high amount of reports on it, you will get a 3 day ban quite fast. These servers used to be a lot easier to cheat on, but they had recently had a better EAC update that had modified the severity/threshold that you could have on them. A smarter server to cheat on, for instance, would be servers that do not have management with Facepunch management. For example, Stevious 2x does not have much ties to EAC/FP compared to the server Rusty Moose.

                                <p>
                                    Server plugins and tools are used by the admins of the server to catch cheaters like you. Some examples of these were mentioned above, but there are a lot more than you think. These tools are external from the game, and can be quite deadly for your account on that server. An example of these external tools are plugins like stash traps. As stated above, stash traps are used to trap the cheaters into opening stashes that will notify the admin, and are the easiest way to get you caught. Example of what a stash trap looks like: https://imgur.com/a/LqCEuQM
                                    BattleMetrics/RustAdmin show sensitive information like IPs, identifiers for the players account, and past usernames. A lot of this information can also be saved at any time, and can be used maliciously. No matter what, I do personally believe that you should use a VPN whenever you connect to a server, as it can give them leverage over you, if they do not have any bit of decency. This information can also be used to link you back to older accounts that you may have used, and had been banned on before. VPN or not, they have the ability to look through those IPs and link it back to all of the past users on that IP. Example of what they can see: https://imgur.com/a/U8Cfxxg. They also have a extension available on the extension store called “BM+” found here: Extension Link
                                    Recoil patterns can also be tracked by admins, and they can give you away faster than anything if you are using recoil modifiers/no recoil on a cheat/script. These are very common in the admin scene, as they are a dead giveaway like stash traps are. These can be avoided with humanization and other features that make you look more legit. Example of what they may see: https://imgur.com/a/gqhupdp
                                    There are Discord bots out there that can show what cheating Discords a person is in. For example, an admin can do .ispy DiscordID and a message will be returned with a Discord embed saying what cheating servers you are in, with what roles you have. For example, .ispy 782737087652036609 would return with the text: Aiden.#1638 is in the following servers: Disarray [support, user, member], Aiden’s Services [Admin, Booster, user, aiden’s solution buyer], etc. This command can be used to expose your Discord server as soon as you start cheating, and get your main Rust/Steam account banned. This can also be used against you if you appeal a ban, as they can just use that information as a ban on itself. Servers that have Steam/Discord kits that are obtained by linking your accounts are a pure example of this data. This can also be used to find older EAC/banned accounts on their network, or on other’s networks. 
                                    When being screenshared/PC checked, the staff may use a program called “Last Activity Viewer” on you. This program is used to check what programs have been run since the BIOS first started/the last reset of your PC. For example, if you run a random .exe called “KAJfkmfs93.exe” then they will notice that and find a pattern and suspect it is a cheat. They could also find a file named a cheat name, from the name of an exe you have on your PC that you run to inject. This can be noticed if you run an exe called “LastCheat.exe” and then run Rust right after you run that file. These patterns mark that you had injected into the game, and had run cheats before you started Rust at times. This tool can be very malicious, as it even shows files that were run inside of a USB stick. There are ways to modify these logs, but the programs/data modifiers are hard to come by, as they get patched along the way. Example of LAV output (click the blue link).

                                <p>
                                    While there are many cheats and spoofers out in the area, there is always the right cheat and spoofer for you and your security. Some past cheats have been exposed for stealing their user base’s private and personal information. There are also built in security features to make sure that people aren’t sharing keys with other people. For example, cheats limit the licensing key to only one hwid, so that it is only used to one person. But, this licensing key can always be reset by contacting their support if they do not have an automatic feature. 
    Some cheats are legit cheats, which are aimed towards people who would like to closet cheat. Closet cheating is when you are playing/acting like you are legit, when you may have some features like esp and recoil modifiers. These cheats are amazing for people who don’t want to go all out and pay a large amount on a rage cheat.
    Most of the cheats out there are rage cheats, which have features that will destroy anyone and everyone in your path. For example, a rage cheat would be QC’s private build. This cheat is widely known within the community to destroy most people who have other rage cheats, and is known to have some of the best functioning features that others have less functionality. Although this example of a rage cheat is insane, it comes with a hefty price on an invite and monthly subscription fee. Some rage cheats aren’t as expensive as others, and yet they still have a good comparison to the more expensive cheats. 
    While cheating, you will want a cheat that has good features and a good rate of no bans. For example, mem-solutions will get you a 3 day ban fast, but yet it has a good selection of features. Cheats like GetRekt, LastCheat, and QC private have a shorter amount of ban rates, and can have weeks of playtime on them, before a ban. 
    When you are cheating, you want to make sure that your HWID is protected from EAC, to make sure that you are not HWID banned. Being HWID banned will make it so your accounts automatically get banned within an hour of you launching Rust. Spoofers will change your HWID to bypass that HWID ban that you may get after cheating awhile. These are very important to use while cheating. Some cheats have built in hwid changers, that emulate EAC. 
    For places to buy these cheats, if you do not have their listed payment methods inside of their Discord/website, you can always buy it from a trusted reseller that may be listed. Most cheats have widespread gateways for payments, but yet some only support cryptocurrencies as a payment. Resellers are there to make sure that all payment methods are supported. For example, some resellers may only support Zelle or CashApp payments, and then others will accept PayPal, Zelle, CashApp, and Venmo.

                                <p>
                                    Having a VPN and account is necessary. VPNs are used to bypass any ip bans that you may obtain whilst cheating. This is also used to last longer while cheating on servers and Rust. Rust accounts are especially expensive, and can be more expensive than Rust cheats. When buying an account, there are two different types of access.
                                    Full access accounts are accounts that you can buy that have email access to the steam account. These are useful for a main account that you do not want taken back from you. These accounts can be bought off of account marketplaces like G2G. G2G is a trusted website that has a widespread amount of payment gateways for people around the world. With the perks that these accounts have, they do come with the down side of them costing much more than a cracked account.
                                    Cracked accounts are non full access, meaning that you do not have access to the email. These are useful for rapidly cheating on servers, and rage cheating. They can be a lot more cheaper than full access accounts, as they have a high risk of being taken back by the owner of the account. You can buy these accounts off of the marketplace lolz.guru. Lolz.Guru has a limited number of payment gateways for people outside of Russia. 
                                    VPNs change and encrypt your IP and other information to protect you from malicious activity. These can also hide your IP from servers. One problem with the widespread VPN providers like NordVPN and SurfShark, is that they do not have residential VPNs. A quick solution to this is the VPN provider, Mysterium. Mysterium is a pay to go VPN that has many residential servers for you to use. This VPN can bypass VPN blocks on servers like AndysolAM, RustAcademy, Stevious, and more servers.

                                    When buying cheats, you should always buy from a trusted shop or reseller. This is because there are people who claim to sell a certain cheat, and they end up scamming the customer who believes that they are an official reseller for that cheat. Reputation is everything inside of any marketplace area, including Rust cheating. You can find verified shops and resellers inside of the cheat’s main Discord usually. Even though they may be verified in them, you should still watch out for them as they could always scam you.
